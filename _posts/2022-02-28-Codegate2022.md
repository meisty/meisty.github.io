I only managed to solve 2 of the web challenges as life got in the way.  But I really enjoyed having a go at them and here are the writeups. 

# Web Challenge - Cafe

With a file to zip file to download.  

I downloaded the file and then started to look at the website.

I registered an account and tried to acquire a cookie from an admin who may be logging in and looking at the page.  This did not work.

I then checked the zip file I had downloaded.  Unzipped it and had a read through some of the files.  

What caught my interest in the `bot.py` file was potential admin credentials.

I tried those on the website and sure enough I was logged in.

Looking at the file `db.sql` I could see the flag would be stored in a post entitled `flag` so I viewed the first post with this and found the flag.

With a file to zip file to download.

Initially I couldn't see anything, just the 404 page.  

I took a look at the code and noticed there was a potential url of `/login/login`.

I tried the url, success.

  style="width: 800px;"/>](../images/codegate2022/superbee/login.png)

I tried some username and password combinations with no success.  After looking at the code again I noticed potential credentials to try:

Once logged in I was greeted with the flag.
